## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Through this challenge, I have revised my knowledge of CSS. Some of the things that I have learned (or re-learned): how to use flexbox to align items, how to set shadows on elements using box-shadow, how to fit an image inside an element, how to make the elements responsive for mobile screens.

### Continued development

Overall it was a nice challenge and I will continue to do some others in order to practice my CSS skills even more.
